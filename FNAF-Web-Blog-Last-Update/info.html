                            Freddy Fazebear&#39;s pizza was once a popular restaurant for 
                        adults and children alike. However, due to a number of incidents
                         including the kidnapping and the murder of five children by a man
                         wearing an empty animatronic suit, sanctions by the Health
                         Department over the numerous reports of dirtiness, and 
                        “the bite of 87”, the pizzeria has fallen on hard times. Freddy
                         Fazbear's Pizza is set to close by the end of the year, as potential 
                        buyers do not want to be associated with the
                        tainted reputation of the company.

                         The four mascots -Freddy fazebear, Bonnie the Bunny,
                         Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate had a particularly
                         foul odor and what appeared to be "blood and mucus"
                         around their eyes and mouths, which concerned parents had
                         interpreted as "reanimated carcasses".

                         Phone Guy remarks in Night 1 phone message that the
                         animatronic haven't been cleaned in their 20+ years of service, which 
                        would explain the nasty odor. The stench could also be attributed
                         to a popular theorythat the missing children were stuffed 
                        into the animatronic suits after they were killed and that their
                         decomposing bodies were producing the repulsive smell.
                         Supposedly, due to the risk of their servos locking up
                        from disuse, the animatronics have been left in a "free-roaming
                         mode" at night over the years. They used to be able to roam
                         freely during the day as well, but The Bite of '87 caused
                         the pizzeria to put a stop to this.

                             It was revealed that Phone Guy disappeared sometime before 
                        the events of the game, as heard during the phone call on 
                        Night 4 and is implied to have been stuffed into a suit 
                        and/or killed. There are many  theories as to what happened 
                        to Phone Guy after the call cuts out, but one can be certain
                        that he was attacked. There is also speculation about
                         a more complicated and twisted version of the plot, due to 
                        the phone message heard during Night 5.
